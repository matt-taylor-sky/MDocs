# Sky Digital Content Objective-C style guidelines

This style guide outlines the coding conventions to be used by iOS teams within Digital Content.


## Introduction

The reason this style guide exists is to ensure that all Objective-C code written by mobile teams within Digital Content is visually consistent, regardless of the developer who wrote it.

The [Ray Wenderlich Objective-C style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/objective-c-style-guide) forms the foundation of this style guide.

## Code Organization

Use `#pragma mark -` to categorize methods in functional groupings and protocol/delegate implementations following this general structure.

```objc
#pragma mark - Lifecycle

- (instancetype)init {}
- (void)dealloc {}
- (void)viewDidLoad {}
- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {}
- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {}

#pragma mark - myProperty Accessors

- (void)setMyProperty:(id)value {}
- (id)myProperty {}

#pragma mark - IBActions

- (IBAction)submitData:(id)sender {}

#pragma mark - UITableViewDataSource

- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {}

#pragma mark - UIScrollViewDelegate

- (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView {}

#pragma mark - MyProtocol

...
```


Please feel free to use `#pragma mark -` to group related methods that are specific to the class you are in. For example,

```objc
#pragma mark - Configure Tableview
- (void)styleTableview {}
- (void)resizeTableview:(CGRect)newSize {}
```


## Spacing

* Indent using 4 spaces. Using tabs should do this by defauly in Xcode, but be sure to check these in Xcode's preferences.
* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.

**Preferred:**
```objc
if (user.isHappy) {
  //Do something
} else {
  //Do something else
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```objc
if (user.isHappy)
{
    //Do something
}
else {
    //Do something else
}
```

* There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but often there should probably be new methods.
* Colon-aligning method invocation should often be avoided.  There are cases where a method signature may have >= 3 colons and colon-aligning makes the code more readable. Please do **NOT** however colon align methods containing blocks because Xcode's indenting makes it illegible.

**Preferred:**

```objc
// blocks are easily readable
[UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^{
  // something
} completion:^(BOOL finished) {
  // something
}];
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
// colon-aligning makes the block indentation hard to read
[UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                 animations:^{
                     // something
                 }
                 completion:^(BOOL finished) {
                     // something
                 }];
```

## Comments

When they are needed, comments should be used to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Any comments that are used must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Block comments should generally be avoided, as code should be as self-documenting as possible, with only the need for intermittent, few-line explanations. *Exception: This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation.*

## Naming

Apple naming conventions should be adhered to wherever possible, especially those related to [memory management rules](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html).

Long, descriptive method and variable names are good.

**Preferred:**

```objc
UIButton *settingsButton;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
UIButton *setBut;
```

#### Class

A three letter prefix should always be used for class names and externally visible constants. 
The prefix itself should be specific to the product you are working on.

e.g. For Football Score Centre you would use FSC

```obj-c
@interface FSCWelcomeViewController : UIViewController

@end
```

#### Category

A three letter prefix should be used for the category name.

```objc-c
@interface NSArray (SKYSorting)

@end
```

A three letter prefix followed by an underscore should be added to each method. If the method was implemented by another category (or added to the class in a future version of iOS or OS X), any calls to that method would result in undefined behavior, since no guarantee is made as to the order in which methods are defined by the runtime.

```objc-c
@interface NSArray<T> (SKYSorting)

- (instancetype)sky_sortedArrayWithWeight:(NSInteger (^)(T object))predicate;

@end
```

Since properties are also synthesised methods they should follow the same rule.

```objc-c
@interface NSUserDefaults (SKYDefaults)

@property (nonatomic, assign, setter=sky_setHasSeenWelcomeJourney:) BOOL *sky_hasSeenWelcomeJourney;

@end
```

#### Constant

All constants should be camel-case but private constants should start with the letter 'k'.

```objc
extern NSString * const ABCPublicString;

static NSString * const kPrivateString = @"private";
```

#### Property

Properties should be camel-case with the leading word being lowercase. Use auto-synthesis for properties rather than manual @synthesize statements unless you have good reason.

**Preferred:**

```objc
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *descriptiveVariableName;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
id varnm;
```

### Underscores

When using properties, instance variables should always be accessed and mutated using `self.`. This means that all properties will be visually distinct, as they will all be prefaced with `self.`. 

An exception to this: inside initializers, the backing instance variable (i.e. _variableName) should be used directly to avoid any potential side effects of the getters/setters.

Local variables should not contain underscores.

## Methods

In method signatures, there should be a space after the method type (-/+ symbol). There should be a space between the method segments (matching Apple's style).  Always include a keyword and be descriptive with the word before the argument which describes the argument.

The usage of the word "and" is reserved.  It should not be used for multiple parameters as illustrated in the `initWithWidth:height:` example below.

**Preferred:**
```objc
- (void)setExampleText:(NSString *)text image:(UIImage *)image;
- (void)sendAction:(SEL)aSelector to:(id)anObject forAllCells:(BOOL)flag;
- (id)viewWithTag:(NSInteger)tag;
- (instancetype)initWithWidth:(CGFloat)width height:(CGFloat)height;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
-(void)setT:(NSString *)text i:(UIImage *)image;
- (void)sendAction:(SEL)aSelector :(id)anObject :(BOOL)flag;
- (id)taggedView:(NSInteger)tag;
- (instancetype)initWithWidth:(CGFloat)width andHeight:(CGFloat)height;
- (instancetype)initWith:(int)width and:(int)height;  // Never do this.
```

## Imports

When looking to make a framework available for use, ensure you use the `@import` statement. For example,
```objc
@import UIKit
```

## Variables

Variables should be named as descriptively as possible. Single letter variable names should be avoided except in `for()` loops.

Asterisks indicating pointers belong with the variable, e.g., `NSString *text` not `NSString* text` or `NSString * text`, except in the case of constants.

[Private properties](#private-properties) should always be used in place of instance variables whenever possible.

**Preferred:**

```objc
@interface SKTutorial : NSObject

@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *tutorialName;

@end
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
@interface SKTutorial : NSObject {
  NSString *tutorialName;
}
```


## Property Attributes

Property attributes should be explicitly listed, and will help new programmers when reading the code.  The order of properties should be storage then atomicity, which is consistent with automatically generated code when connecting UI elements from Interface Builder.

**Preferred:**

```objc
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIView *containerView;
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *tutorialName;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
@property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UIView *containerView;
@property (nonatomic) NSString *tutorialName;
```

Properties with mutable counterparts (e.g. NSString) should prefer `copy` instead of `strong`. 
Why? Even if you declared a property as `NSString` somebody might pass in an instance of an `NSMutableString` and then change it without you noticing that.  

**Preferred:**

```objc
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSString *tutorialName;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *tutorialName;
```

If a property is set only in the initializer, ensure to set it as `readonly`

## Dot-Notation Syntax

Dot-notation should **always** be used for accessing or mutating properties, as it makes code more concise. Bracket notation is preferred in all other instances.

**Preferred:**
```objc
NSInteger arrayCount = [self.array count];
view.backgroundColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
```

**Not Preferred:**
```objc
NSInteger arrayCount = self.array.count;
[view setBackgroundColor:[UIColor orangeColor]];
UIApplication.sharedApplication.delegate;
```

## Literals

`NSString`, `NSDictionary`, `NSArray`, and `NSNumber` literals should be used whenever creating immutable instances of those objects. Pay special care that `nil` values can not be passed into `NSArray` or `NSDictionary` literals, as this will cause a crash.

**Preferred:**

```objc
NSArray *names = @[@"Brian", @"Matt", @"Chris", @"Alex", @"Steve", @"Paul"];
NSDictionary *productManagers = @{@"iPhone": @"Kate", @"iPad": @"Kamal", @"Mobile Web": @"Bill"};
NSNumber *shouldUseLiterals = @YES;
NSNumber *buildingStreetNumber = @10018;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
NSArray *names = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Brian", @"Matt", @"Chris", @"Alex", @"Steve", @"Paul", nil];
NSDictionary *productManagers = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @"Kate", @"iPhone", @"Kamal", @"iPad", @"Bill", @"Mobile Web", nil];
NSNumber *shouldUseLiterals = [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES];
NSNumber *buildingStreetNumber = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:10018];
```

## Constants

Constants are preferred over in-line string literals or numbers, as they allow for easy reproduction of commonly used variables and can be quickly changed without the need for find and replace. Constants should be declared as `static` constants and not `#define`s unless explicitly being used as a macro.

**Preferred:**

```objc
static NSString * const SKAboutViewControllerCompanyName = @"Sky UK";
static CGFloat const SKImageThumbnailHeight = 50.0;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
#define CompanyName @"Sky UK"
#define thumbnailHeight 2
```

## Enumerated Types

When using `enum`s, it is recommended to use the new fixed underlying type specification because it has stronger type checking and code completion. The SDK now includes a macro to facilitate and encourage use of fixed underlying types: `NS_ENUM()`

**For Example:**

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, SKLeftMenuTopItemType) {
  SKLeftMenuTopItemMain,
  SKLeftMenuTopItemShows,
  SKLeftMenuTopItemSchedule
};
```

You can also make explicit value assignments (showing older k-style constant definition):

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, SKGlobalConstants) {
  SKPinSizeMin = 1,
  SKPinSizeMax = 5,
  SKPinCountMin = 100,
  SKPinCountMax = 500,
};
```

Older k-style constant definitions within enums should be **avoided** unless writing CoreFoundation C code (unlikely).

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
enum GlobalConstants {
  kMaxPinSize = 5,
  kMaxPinCount = 500,
};
```


## Case Statements

Braces are not required for case statements, unless the case contains more than one line.  

```objc
switch (condition) {
  case 1:
    // ...
    break;
  case 2: {
    // ...
    // Multi-line example using braces
    break;
  }
  default: 
    // ...
    break;
}

```

When using an enumerated type for a switch, 'default' is not needed.


## Private Properties

Private properties should be declared in class extensions (anonymous categories) in the implementation file of a class. Named categories (such as `private`) should never be used unless extending another class. The anonymous category can be shared/exposed for testing using the <headerfile>+Private.h file naming convention.


## Booleans

Objective-C uses `YES` and `NO`.  Therefore `true` and `false` should only be used for CoreFoundation, C or C++ code.  Since `nil` resolves to `NO` it is unnecessary to compare it in conditions. Never compare something directly to `YES`, because `YES` is defined to 1 and a `BOOL` can be up to 8 bits.

This allows for more consistency across files and greater visual clarity.

**Preferred:**

```objc
if (someObject) {}
if (![anotherObject boolValue]) {}
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
if (someObject == nil) {}
if ([anotherObject boolValue] == NO) {}
if (isAwesome == YES) {} // Never do this.
if (isAwesome == true) {} // Never do this.
```

If the name of a `BOOL` property is expressed as an adjective, the property can omit the “is” prefix but specifies the conventional name for the get accessor, for example:

```objc
@property (assign, getter=isEditable) BOOL editable;
```

## Conditionals

Conditional bodies should always use braces, even when a conditional body could be written without braces (e.g., it is one line only) to prevent future errors.

**Preferred:**
```objc
if (!error) {
  return success;
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```objc
if (!error)
  return success;
```

or

```objc
if (!error) return success;
```

The condition should be spaced in the most readable fashion. e.g. `if (myBool == YES)` as opposed to `if (myBool==YES)`.

### Ternary Operator

The Ternary operator, `?:` , should only be used when it increases clarity or code neatness. A single condition is usually all that should be evaluated. Evaluating multiple conditions is usually more understandable as an `if` statement, or refactored into instance variables. In general, the best use of the ternary operator is during assignment of a variable and deciding which value to use.

Non-boolean variables should be compared against something, and parentheses are added for improved readability.  If the variable being compared is a boolean type, then no parentheses are needed.

**Preferred:**
```objc
NSInteger value = 5;
result = (value != 0) ? x : y;

BOOL isHorizontal = YES;
result = isHorizontal ? x : y;
```

**Not Preferred:**
```objc
result = a > b ? x = c > d ? c : d : y;
```

## Init Methods

Init methods should follow the convention provided by Apple's generated code template.  A return type of 'instancetype' should also be used instead of 'id'.

```objc
- (instancetype)init {
  self = [super init];
  if (self) {
    // ...
  }
  return self;
}
```

## Class Constructor Methods

Where class constructor methods are used, these should always return type of 'instancetype' and never 'id'. This ensures the compiler correctly infers the result type. 

```objc
@interface Airplane
+ (instancetype)airplaneWithType:(SKAirplaneType)type;
@end
```

## CGRect Functions

When accessing the `x`, `y`, `width` or `height` of a `CGRect`, always use the [`CGGeometry` functions](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CGGeometry/Reference/reference.html) instead of direct struct member access.

**Preferred:**

```objc
CGRect frame = self.view.frame;

CGFloat x = CGRectGetMinX(frame);
CGFloat y = CGRectGetMinY(frame);
CGFloat width = CGRectGetWidth(frame);
CGFloat height = CGRectGetHeight(frame);
CGRect frame = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, width, height);
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
CGRect frame = self.view.frame;

CGFloat x = frame.origin.x;
CGFloat y = frame.origin.y;
CGFloat width = frame.size.width;
CGFloat height = frame.size.height;
CGRect frame = (CGRect){ .origin = CGPointZero, .size = frame.size };
```

## Golden Path

When coding with conditionals, the left hand margin of the code should be the "golden" or "happy" path.  That is, don't nest `if` statements.  Multiple return statements are OK.

**Preferred:**

```objc
- (void)someMethod {
  if (![someOther boolValue]) {
	return;
  }

  //Do something important
}
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
- (void)someMethod {
  if ([someOther boolValue]) {
    //Do something important
  }
}
```

## Error handling

When methods return an error parameter by reference, switch on the returned value, not the error variable.

**Preferred:**
```objc
NSError *error;
if (![self trySomethingWithError:&error]) {
  // Handle Error
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```objc
NSError *error;
[self trySomethingWithError:&error];
if (error) {
  // Handle Error
}
```

Some of Apple’s APIs write garbage values to the error parameter (if non-NULL) in successful cases, so switching on the error can cause false negatives (and subsequently crash).

## Singletons

Singleton objects should use a thread-safe pattern for creating their shared instance to prevent future crashes.
```objc
+ (instancetype)sharedInstance {
  static id sharedInstance = nil;

  static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
  dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
    sharedInstance = [[self alloc] init];
  });

  return sharedInstance;
}
```

## Debugging

Please note that the use of `NSAssert` is permitted in suitable circumstances, providing that an appropriate message is provided for when the assertion fails and that safeguards are in place should the assertion fail in the production app.

The use of `NSLog` in production code is strictly forbidden. Either ensure that all `NSLog` statements are removed prior to comitting or use one of many debug logging tools (such as [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack)).

## Xcode project

The physical files should be kept in sync with the Xcode project files in order to avoid file sprawl. Any Xcode groups created should be reflected by folders in the filesystem. Code should be grouped not only by type, but also by feature for greater clarity.

If possible turn on "Treat Warnings as Errors" in the target's Build Settings, but ensure you enable as many additional warnings as possible.
